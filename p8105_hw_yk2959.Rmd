```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1
I have used the code provided and ran the code directly in the console to download the package containing the penguins dataset.

Next, I will use the following code to load the penguins dataset. 

```{Load Penguins dataset and explore contents of dataset}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

str(penguins)

View(penguins$species)
View(penguins$island)

nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)

```

*This dataset contains the following variables:* 
1. species: factor with 3 levels, "Adelie","Chinstrap", and "Gentoo"
2. island: factor with 3 levels, "Biscoe","Dream" and "Torgersen"
3. bill length (mm): numerical variable  
4. bill depth: (mm): numerical variable  
5. flipper length: integer variable 
6. body mass (g): integer variable
7. sex: factor with 2 levels, "female" and "male"
8. year: integer variable

*The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns.* 

the data in this dataset, including names / values of important variables
the size of the dataset (using nrow and ncol)
the mean flipper length




## Problem 2



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
