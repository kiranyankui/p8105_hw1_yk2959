```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Problem 1
#### Loading and exploring the dataset

I have used the code provided and ran the code directly in the console to download the package containing the penguins dataset.

*Next, I will use the following code to load and explore the penguins dataset.* 

```{r code for loading and exploring the penguins dataset}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

str(penguins)

View(penguins$species)
View(penguins$island)

nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
